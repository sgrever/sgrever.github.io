A news feed for tech-related news, deployed and refreshed by Github Actions.  

---

Using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), I pull top articles for the API category 'Technology' as well as keywords 'Cybersecurity', 'DOGE', and 'OpenAI'. The json results are cleaned and formatted into an interactive table.

Clicking anywhere in a table row opens the full-length article. Additionally, hovering over table headers reveals a descriptive text.
