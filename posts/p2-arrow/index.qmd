How I leveraged Apache Arrow to analyze NYCs EMS Dispatch calls from 2007-2023.  

---

In resource-limited and siloed organizations, data sharing is cumbersome. This is especially the case when departments without a shared platform must collaboratively process datasets. This inspired me to leverage [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) as a means to ingest, process, and analyze big data.

This project uses New York City dispatch calls data from 2007 to 2024. The [EMS Incident Dispatch Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj/about_data) contains 27M records detailing incident location, perceived call severity, and Fire Department response time.
