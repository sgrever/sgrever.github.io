This is especially the case when departments without a shared platform must collaboratively process datasets. This inspired me to leverage Apache Arrow as a means to ingest, process, and analyze big data.\n\n\n\nApache Arrow logo\n\n\nThis project uses New York City dispatch calls data from 2007 to 2024. The EMS Incident Dispatch Data contains 27M records detailing incident location, perceived call severity, and Fire Department response time.\n\n\n\nCall codes distribution\n\n\nFor full details, please see the following:\n\nREPORT\n\n\nCODE (REPO)"
