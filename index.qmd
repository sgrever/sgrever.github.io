Welcome! I've been a healthcare data analytics professional for two years, supporting community health data management, impact evaluation, and accreditation at Kaiser Permanente. Prior to this, I conducted descriptive analytics for Social Determinants of Health research.  

I'm drawn to **collaborating**, **building** and **deploying** R solutions for clean, efficient data workflows.  

In my free time, I enjoy aerial hammock, cooking Sweetgreen dupes, and reading sci-fi.
